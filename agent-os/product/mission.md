## The Problem

### Fragmented Course Discovery

Finding quality survival training courses is difficult and time-consuming. Students must search multiple websites, contact schools individually, and often can't compare courses effectively. This leads to missed opportunities, suboptimal training choices, and frustration in the discovery process.

**Our Solution:** Centralized marketplace with comprehensive course listings, advanced filtering by location, difficulty, environment, price, and duration, plus detailed school information.

### Inefficient Course Management

Survival schools struggle with manual course administration, limited online presence, and difficulty reaching their target audience. This results in underutilized capacity, missed revenue opportunities, and operational inefficiencies.

**Our Solution:** Comprehensive admin dashboard with course management, student tracking, analytics, and marketing tools that streamline operations.

### Limited Course Information

Students often lack sufficient information to make informed decisions about survival courses, including detailed descriptions, instructor credentials, real student reviews, and course availability. This leads to uncertainty and lower enrollment rates.

**Our Solution:** Rich course profiles with photos, detailed descriptions, instructor bios, verified reviews, and real-time availability updates.

## Differentiators

### Specialized Survival Course Focus

Unlike generic outdoor activity platforms, we provide specialized survival course filtering by difficulty, environment, duration, and skill focus. This results in more relevant course matches and better student outcomes.

### Integrated School Management Platform

Unlike basic listing services, we provide schools with a complete admin dashboard for course management, student tracking, and business analytics. This results in increased operational efficiency and revenue growth.
