## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

LiveThrough is a comprehensive survival course marketplace that connects outdoor enthusiasts and survival students with certified survival schools and instructors. The platform provides advanced course discovery, school management tools, and a complete booking ecosystem.

### Context

The survival training market is fragmented and lacks a centralized platform for course discovery and management. Students struggle to find quality courses, while schools lack efficient tools to reach their target audience and manage their operations. LiveThrough addresses this gap by providing a specialized marketplace with comprehensive features for both students and schools.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Outdoor Activity Platform**
   - Pros: Broader market reach, existing user base
   - Cons: Not specialized for survival training, diluted user experience, high competition

2. **Simple Course Listing Directory**
   - Pros: Faster time to market, lower development complexity
   - Cons: Limited value proposition, no competitive advantage, poor monetization potential

3. **School Management Software Only**
   - Pros: Focused on B2B market, higher pricing potential
   - Cons: Limited market size, requires significant sales effort, no network effects

### Rationale

The marketplace approach was chosen because it:
- Creates network effects between students and schools
- Provides multiple revenue streams (commission, subscription, premium features)
- Addresses the core problem of fragmented course discovery
- Allows for data-driven improvements and personalization
- Scales efficiently with technology rather than manual processes

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High growth potential with network effects
- Multiple revenue streams and business models
- Valuable data assets for future AI/ML features
- Strong competitive moat through platform effects
- Global scalability with minimal operational overhead

**Negative:**
- Complex two-sided marketplace dynamics
- Requires significant initial investment in features
- Chicken-and-egg problem for user acquisition
- High expectations for user experience and reliability
- Regulatory considerations for course certification and safety

## 2024-12-19: Technology Stack Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Selected Next.js 15 with React 19, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS as the primary technology stack for LiveThrough.

### Context

The platform requires rapid development, excellent user experience, real-time features, and scalable infrastructure. The chosen stack balances developer productivity, performance, and maintainability.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional LAMP Stack**
   - Pros: Proven, extensive documentation, large developer pool
   - Cons: Slower development, more infrastructure management, limited real-time capabilities

2. **Full-Stack JavaScript (MERN)**
   - Pros: JavaScript throughout, good ecosystem
   - Cons: More complex setup, separate backend management, less integrated

3. **Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda + React)**
   - Pros: Scalable, pay-per-use pricing
   - Cons: Cold start issues, vendor lock-in, complex debugging

### Rationale

Next.js + Supabase provides:
- Rapid development with excellent DX
- Built-in SSR/SSG for performance and SEO
- Integrated real-time features
- Managed backend with minimal DevOps
- Strong TypeScript support
- Excellent deployment options

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development cycles
- Excellent performance and SEO
- Reduced infrastructure management
- Strong developer experience
- Built-in security and scalability

**Negative:**
- Vendor dependency on Supabase
- Learning curve for team members
- Potential cost scaling with usage
- Limited customization of backend services

## 2024-12-19: User Experience Design Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Design Team, Development Team

### Decision

Adopted a mobile-first, dark theme design approach with emphasis on course discovery and filtering as the primary user experience.

### Context

Survival course students are often outdoor enthusiasts who may access the platform from mobile devices in various lighting conditions. The experience must be intuitive and efficient for course discovery.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Desktop-First Design**
   - Pros: More screen real estate, complex features easier to implement
   - Cons: Poor mobile experience, doesn't match user behavior patterns

2. **Light Theme Only**
   - Pros: Familiar design patterns, better accessibility for some users
   - Cons: Poor outdoor visibility, doesn't match outdoor enthusiast aesthetic

3. **Minimalist Design**
   - Pros: Clean, fast loading, less cognitive load
   - Cons: May appear less professional, limited feature showcase

### Rationale

Mobile-first dark theme design:
- Matches user behavior (mobile usage in outdoor settings)
- Provides better visibility in various lighting conditions
- Creates distinctive brand identity
- Enables responsive design across all devices
- Supports accessibility with proper contrast ratios

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better user experience for target audience
- Distinctive brand identity
- Improved accessibility in outdoor settings
- Consistent experience across devices
- Reduced eye strain in low-light conditions

**Negative:**
- Requires careful contrast and accessibility testing
- May not appeal to all user segments
- Additional design complexity for light theme support
- Potential performance impact of dark theme implementation
