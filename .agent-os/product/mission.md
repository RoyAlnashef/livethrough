## The Problem

### Fragmented Course Discovery

Finding quality survival training courses is difficult and time-consuming. Students must search multiple websites, contact schools individually, and often can't compare courses effectively. This leads to missed opportunities and suboptimal training choices.

**Our Solution:** Centralized marketplace with comprehensive course listings, advanced filtering, and detailed school information.

### Inefficient Course Management

Survival schools struggle with manual course administration, limited online presence, and difficulty reaching their target audience. This results in underutilized capacity and missed revenue opportunities.

**Our Solution:** Comprehensive admin dashboard with course management, student tracking, and marketing tools.

### Limited Course Information

Students often lack sufficient information to make informed decisions about survival courses, including detailed descriptions, instructor credentials, and real student reviews.

**Our Solution:** Rich course profiles with photos, detailed descriptions, instructor bios, and verified reviews.

## Differentiators

### Comprehensive Course Discovery

Unlike generic outdoor activity platforms, we provide specialized survival course filtering by difficulty, environment, duration, and skill focus. This results in more relevant course matches and better student outcomes.

### Integrated School Management

Unlike basic listing services, we provide schools with a complete admin dashboard for course management, student tracking, and business analytics. This results in increased operational efficiency and revenue growth.

### Quality Assurance System

Unlike unverified course listings, we implement a review system and school verification process. This results in higher trust and better course quality for students.
