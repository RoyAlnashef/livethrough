# Advertisement Integration Spec

## 3. Technical Requirements
- **Ad Placement:**
  - ✅ Define ad slots/locations (e.g., sidebar, between content, footer, dashboard, course pages).
  - ✅ Responsive design for mobile/desktop.
- **Ad Providers:**
  - ✅ Support for Google AdSense (MVP) - Infrastructure ready, waiting for account approval.
  - ✅ Extensible for future direct ad partners.

    <div className={className} id={`ad-slot-${slotId}`}
         style={{ minHeight: 90, width: '100%' }}>
      {/* AdSense script or fallback */}
      <ins className="adsbygoogle"
